The Open Revenue project is an initiative under The Open Source Project (TOSP), focusing on providing resources and information for generating revenue through open source projects. It explores various revenue generation methods like donations, crowdfunding, custom development, dual licensing, sponsorships, training, merchandising, SaaS, and the open-core model. Each method is detailed with descriptions, examples, strategies, and more information links.

The project encourages community involvement in various ways such as contributing code, improving documentation, supporting the community, and spreading the word. Open Revenue operates under the CC0 1.0 Universal License and offers a platform for interaction and queries through Discord and GitHub.
